# Topic Modeling of PureGym Customer Reviews
**Background Context**
This project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from customer reviews of PureGym, a multinational gym chain. Reviews were collected from Trustpilot and Google to identify recurring negative feedback and support improvements in customer satisfaction. Techniques such as BERTopic, Gensimâ€™s LDA, and Phi-4.0 were used for topic modeling, while emotion analysis helped to uncover emotional triggers. The ultimate goal was to generate actionable recommendations for improving service quality based on real user experiences.

**Objective**
The objective of this project was to:

 - Apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling techniques to identify and interpret recurring themes in customer complaints.

 - Filter reviews with fewer than 3 stars to isolate negative feedback and improve the quality of insights.

 - Generate actionable recommendations for PureGym management based on the most common topics and emotional drivers found in the data.

**Key Outcomes**
 - Identified major areas of concern such as equipment maintenance, facility hygiene, staff behavior, overcrowding, and membership issues.

 - Used BERTopic, Gensim LDA, and Phi-4.0 to compare and validate themes across different models.

 - Conducted emotion analysis to determine that anger, sadness, and frustration were the most common emotional responses.

 - Generated 14 actionable recommendations using the Phi-4.0 model based on the most frequent issues in negative reviews.

**Showcased Skills**
 - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text cleaning, word frequency analysis, sentiment & emotion detection.

 - Topic Modeling: Implementation and comparison of BERTopic, Gensim LDA, and Phi-4.0 for unsupervised learning.

 - Data Visualization: Word clouds, topic cluster visualizations (BERTopic & pyLDAvis), bar plots.

 - AI-Assisted Insights: Prompting Phi-4.0 to convert topics into practical, management-level recommendations.
